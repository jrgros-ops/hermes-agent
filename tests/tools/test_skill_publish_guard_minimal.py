"""Cross-process regression witness for live skill publication (A1B, A1G contract).

Hermes 0.20.5 minimal re-derivation. This is the only regression test
required to prove the contract — the historical A1G test suite (1536+
lines) tested a frozen internal API we are not porting. A1B alone
witnesses:

  CASE_1_SAME_NAME_RACE              — two processes race the same
                                       canonical identity; exactly one
                                       publishes, the other observes
                                       lock-acquisition failure.
  CASE_2_LOCK_RELEASE_AFTER_FAILURE  — a failing publisher does not
                                       leave a stale lock for the
                                       next legitimate publication.
  CASE_3_DIFFERENT_NAME_NONINTERFERENCE — different canonical identities
                                          do not contend; the lock is
                                          keyed by name, not a global
                                          namespace.
  CASE_4_PERMISSION_OR_IO_FAILURE    — chmod 000 on the locks/ parent
                                       surfaces as a permission error,
                                       NOT as a duplicate-name refusal.

Uses ``multiprocessing`` with ``spawn`` so each child is a fresh
interpreter (real cross-process, not threads). Synchronization is via
``multiprocessing.Event`` primitives + a queue rendezvous — no sleeps
as the sole synchronization mechanism. Children are joined with
timeouts; any stuck process is terminated, killed, and reaped before
the test exits. No orphan process or leaked lock may remain.

    A1B (Hermes 0.20.5 TOCTOU repair): BOTH the publisher that
    holds the canonical-name lock during the race AND the
    publisher that races against it must invoke the real public
    ``skill_manage`` create path. The lock is the thing
    ``_create_skill`` acquires internally — there is no separate
    "hold the lock manually" branch in production. If only one of
    the two processes exercised the real public path, the witness
    would prove lock exclusion but not two-publisher stale-check
    safety.

    Determinism: the FIRST invocation of the in-lock authoritative
    ``_find_skill`` inside ``_create_skill`` is monkey-patched (in
    this child only) to block on ``a_in_lock`` and ``release_a``
    Events. This freezes Publisher A inside the guarded region
    while Publisher B races against it. After the rendezvous, the
    patch is removed and the real ``_find_skill`` runs normally.

    The patch is applied to ``tools.skill_manager_tool._find_skill``
    because that is the exact symbol ``_create_skill`` calls into
    from inside the guard — there is no production-only test hook.

    This is the single source of truth for the race contract. Both

    pre-TOCTOU-repair implementation) MUST go through this helper so
    that the contract is enforced uniformly — a test that describes
    a failure semantically but does not reject it is a defect.

    Contract (the GOOD post-fix semantics, derived from real
    production behavior under the deterministic rendezvous):

      1. Both processes invoke the real public path with no
         worker_error.
      2. EXACTLY ONE ``success=True`` — the publisher that acquired
         the canonical-name lock and completed the guarded region.
      3. EXACTLY ONE ``lock_acquisition_failure=True`` — the loser
         whose ``live_skill_publish_guard`` raised
         ``SkillPublishLockError`` while the winner held the lock.
         This is the discriminating signal: under the pre-fix
         ordering, the loser would see a duplicate-name refusal
         instead.
      4. ZERO duplicate-name refusals — the loser never reaches
         the in-lock duplicate check because the lock itself
         rejects it.
      5. The winner is the role that was deterministically paused
         INSIDE the guard (the ``expected_winner_role``), not the
         late-arriving contender.
      6. Exactly ONE ``SKILL.md`` on disk — written by the winner.

    A1B (Hermes 0.20.5 TOCTOU repair): BOTH processes invoke the real
    public ``skill_manage(action="create", ...)`` path. Neither process
    substitutes a direct ``live_skill_publish_guard`` call for its
    publication operation. This proves the test is not a lock-exclusion
    witness that ignores the stale-check vulnerability it is meant to
    guard against.

    Deterministic rendezvous: Publisher A enters ``skill_manage`` and
    reaches the in-lock authoritative ``_find_skill`` (the second
    call in the public path; the first is a pre-mutation audit-ledger
    capture that runs BEFORE the guard). A patches its own
    process-local ``_find_skill`` to block on Events, freezes inside
    the guard holding the canonical-name lock, and signals the
    parent. The parent then starts Publisher B, which enters the real
    public ``skill_manage`` path and attempts to publish while A
    still holds the lock.

    B's outcome is determined by the publication primitive's actual
    bounded-lock semantics: under the post-fix production code the
    in-lock authoritative duplicate check AND the mutation live
    INSIDE one ``live_skill_publish_guard``, so B's
    ``live_skill_publish_guard`` call observes ``EWOULDBLOCK`` and
    the caller surfaces ``lock_acquisition_failure=True``. That is
    the GOOD loser semantic the contract enforces.

    Why this catches the pre-fix implementation: under the Sol-
    rejected ordering (authoritative duplicate lookup OUTSIDE the
    guard, mutation inside), the holder is paused BEFORE the guard
    at the pre-lock check, the contender acquires the lock and
    writes successfully, and the holder — when released — sees the
    contender's just-written SKILL.md and refuses with "already
    exists". The GOOD contract rejects this loser semantic. See
    ``test_case_1_discriminates_against_prelock_duplicate_check``

# MF2/MF3/MF4 — bounded regression tests for the A1G repair
# ===========================================================================
# These tests are ADDITIVE — they do not modify the existing A1B/A1G race
# witnesses above. Each MF* test class is a narrowly scoped contract witness
# that targets exactly one of the three must-fix defects and discriminates
# against the pre-fix production behavior described in the A1G report.
#
# Conventions:
#   - All tests use the per-test ``hermes_home`` fixture (isolated HOME).
#   - MF2 tests build a real skills tree on disk and exercise the real
#     ``skill_manage`` create path.
#   - MF3/MF4 tests patch ``fcntl.flock`` / ``os.open`` / ``os.close`` at
#     import-time of the guard module. The patches are scoped to the
#     ``live_skill_publish_guard`` instance attributes so we never globally
#     break pytest's own file descriptor handling.

#
# The guard serializes publication with a byte-range/advisory file lock. On
# POSIX that is ``fcntl.flock``; on Windows ``fcntl`` does not exist at all
# and the platform primitive is ``msvcrt.locking``. These witnesses pin the
# cross-platform contract:
#
#   MF1-A  the module imports on Windows (where ``fcntl`` is absent)
#   MF1-B  Windows acquisition uses msvcrt LK_NBLCK, one byte, at offset 0
#   MF1-C  Windows release uses msvcrt LK_UNLCK, one byte, BEFORE fd close
#   MF1-D  POSIX still uses fcntl.flock and never requires msvcrt
#   MF1-E  Windows contention errnos classify as CONTENTION (retryable)
#   MF1-F  a non-contention Windows failure classifies as HARD
#   MF1-G  Windows unlock failure stays observable and never masks the body
#
# Windows is simulated WITHOUT creating repo-root ``fcntl``/``msvcrt`` files
# (those shadow the real stdlib for every process in the tree). Instead each
# witness loads a private copy of the guard module through
# ``importlib.util.spec_from_file_location`` under a patched
# ``sys.modules`` / ``sys.platform`` view, so the production module object
# imported by the rest of the suite is never mutated.

# MF1 NATIVE WINDOWS COMPANION (windows_only lane)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The eight MF1 witnesses above simulate Windows on any host: they inject a
# fake ``msvcrt``, block ``fcntl``, and patch ``sys.platform``. That proves the
# guard's platform DISPATCH is structured correctly, but it cannot prove the
# real OS honours the lock — a fake ``locking()`` records a call, it does not
# serialize anything. These companions close that gap by running the REAL
# primitive on a real Windows host.
#
# Division of labour, deliberately minimal (no duplication of the simulated
# suite):
#
#   NW1  real import/binding state (fcntl absent, msvcrt present)
#   NW2  real msvcrt acquire + release through the public guard, including
#        byte-0 materialisation on an initially empty lock file
#   NW3  REAL cross-process contention: a child process holds the lock, the
#        parent observes the genuine OS error mapped to LOCK_KIND_CONTENTION,
#        then acquisition succeeds after the holder releases
#
# Hard-failure (EIO) and MF4 cleanup-failure injection stay with the simulated
# tests on purpose: manufacturing a genuine EIO or a failing LK_UNLCK from a
# real Windows filesystem needs privileged/flaky setup (ACL games, filter
# drivers, forced dismounts) whose failure modes are environmental rather than
# behavioural. Deterministic fault injection is the more honest contract for
# those two, and the real-OS tests below cover the parts injection cannot:
# that the primitive exists, is callable, and actually excludes a second
# process.
#
# These tests carry a literal ``@pytest.mark.windows_only`` because
# ``scripts/ci/list_os_marked_tests.py`` greps the marker NAME out of the
# source to decide which FILES the Windows lane imports; ``-m windows_only``
# then decides which tests run. A file-local alias would be discovered but
# deselected, reporting green over zero coverage.
