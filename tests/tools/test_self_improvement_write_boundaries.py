"""T4 / T5 / T6 — L2 write boundaries for skill / memory / suggestions.

Covers:
  T4 — Direct skill bypass from background review is denied; no
       writes reach a temp skill directory.
  T5 — Memory writes from background review are denied; reads remain
       available; no MEMORY.md / USER.md is created under tmp.
  T6 — Cron-suggestion writes from background review are denied; no
       suggestions.json is created under tmp.
  T7 — Normal session, no env vars: behaviour preserved.

Isolation:
  Every test runs against a per-test HERMES_HOME autouse-tempdir
  (see ``tests/conftest.py::_isolate_hermes_home``). No test touches
  ``~/.hermes/`` or any user-installed skill.

        Under ``is_background_review()`` AND no env knobs, the guard
        returns ``None`` so the existing pinned/external/bundled gates
        run exactly as before. We can't exercise the actual file write
        (requires validation, full skill_manage plumbing) — locking that
        the L2 gate is transparent is the contract.

        S-7 migration: Phase 2 ContextVar is the canonical L2
        authorization source. The L2 guard no longer reads env vars at
        the call site, so monkeypatch.setenv("HERMES_DISABLE_SELF_IMPROVEMENT", "0")
        is ineffective under Phase 2. The test now installs the ALLOW
        Decision via the typed ContextVar (see ``allow_decision``
        fixture). The guard then sees Decision.allow=True and returns
        None to fall through.

        S-13 migration: the background-review write guard additionally
        refuses any skill whose usage record is not curator-managed
        (see ``_is_curator_managed_record`` in ``tools/skill_usage`` —
        a missing record and ``created_by: null`` both fail closed).
        For the ALLOW path to actually fall through to ``None``, the
        probe skill must be opted into curator management BEFORE the
        guard is invoked. ``adopt_skill`` writes the canonical
        ``created_by: agent`` marker on a real, on-disk skill
        directory, which is exactly what the production path consumes.
        After adoption, ``skill_usage.is_curator_managed`` confirms the
        record exists, then the guard's managed-skill gate passes and
        the ALLOW Decision drives the final ``None`` return value.
        Production guard strength is unchanged; we only supply the
        precondition the real background-review fork would already
        have via ``hermes curator adopt <name>``.
