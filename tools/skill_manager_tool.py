Skill Manager Tool -- Agent-Managed Skill Creation & Editing

Allows the agent to create, update, and delete skills, turning successful
approaches into reusable procedural knowledge. New skills are created in
~/.hermes/skills/. Existing skills (bundled, hub-installed, or user-created)
can be modified or deleted wherever they live.

Skills are the agent's procedural memory: they capture *how to do a specific
type of task* based on proven experience. General memory (MEMORY.md, USER.md) is
broad and declarative. Skills are narrow and actionable.

Actions:
  create     -- Create a new skill (SKILL.md + directory structure)
  edit       -- Replace the SKILL.md content of a user skill (full rewrite)
  patch      -- Targeted find-and-replace within SKILL.md or any supporting file
  delete     -- Remove a user skill entirely
  write_file -- Add/overwrite a supporting file (reference, template, script, asset)
  remove_file-- Remove a supporting file from a user skill

Directory layout for user skills:
    ~/.hermes/skills/
    ├── my-skill/

    """Interprocess (POSIX or Windows) lock for skill mutations.

    ``canonical_skill_path`` is the resolved canonical skill directory the
    caller intends to mutate.  The lock file lives OUTSIDE every skills
    root (see ``_resolve_lock_parent``) so a misbehaving ``rmtree`` inside
    the live tree cannot drop the lock and so discovery/loaders that
    walk the skills tree never see it.

    POSIX uses ``fcntl.flock(LOCK_EX)``; Windows uses ``msvcrt.locking``
    on the same byte of the same file.  Both paths are fail-closed —

      * any acquisition failure raises ``PermissionError``;
      * any release or close failure raises ``_SkillMutationLockReleaseFailure``
        AFTER both attempts have been made (so both errors are preserved
        if both failed);
      * the lock file is NEVER removed — the lock is held by the kernel,
        not by the file's existence on disk.

    The lock file is opened with ``O_NOFOLLOW`` on POSIX (when the
    constant is available), validated against symlinks / directories
    via lstat before open and against the open fd's identity via fstat
    after open.  Any identity mismatch raises ``PermissionError`` and
    prevents entry into the critical section.
